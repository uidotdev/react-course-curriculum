<h3 align="center">React Course Curriculum - <a href="https://hn.ui.dev/">Hacker News Clone</a></h3>

### Info

This is the repository for UI.dev's "React" course curriculum project.

For more information on the course, visit __[ui.dev/react](https://ui.dev/react/)__.

### Project

This is a (soft) "Hacker News" clone. 

You can view the final project at __[hn.ui.dev](https://hn.ui.dev/)__

### Solution

If you get stuck, you can view my solution by checking out the `solution` branch. 

You will need to use React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop to show the HTML posts that the API gives you. We didn't cover it in the course but you can [read about it here](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#dangerouslysetinnerhtml).

### Approaches

There are a few different ways you can approach this, each with varying difficulties. 

+ Hardest: Look at the [finished project](https://hn.ui.dev/) and build it. This is obviously the hardest approach but the one you'll gain the most learning from. The only thing that you'll need is the documentation for the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

+ Whatever word is between "Hardest" and "Easiest": Copy my [api.js](https://github.com/uidotdev/react-course-curriculum/blob/solution/app/utils/api.js) file to your project then build the app. After all, you're here to learn React, not the Hacker News API. If you took this approach, I wouldn't blame you.

+ Easiest: Take 10-15 minutes to walk through [my code](https://github.com/uidotdev/react-course-curriculum/tree/solution). Notice how I approached different problems and how you may or may not want to do something similar. From there, start building and reference my project only as you need it.
